# Data Analytics Portfolio 
Repository containing some projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

### NASDAQ stock portfolio 
  Developed a Python program utilizing R, MySQL, Gurobi, Excel and Solver to assist users in selecting  NASDAQ stocks portfolio, by computing efficient frontier.  The project uses data that consists of average monthly returns for many different NASDAQ stock over several year, and generates a graph illustrating maximized returns at various risk levels with R markdown. It also includes using R to populate the covariance matrix, Python to create the Gurobi model, and SQL to create the database dump that supports R and Python. 

 ### Happiness Report Exploratory Analysis: 
  This project delves into the World Happiness Report, a comprehensive survey ranking 155 countries by their happiness levels. The project's primary objective is to conduct an exploratory analysis, leveraging machine learning techniques to unveil relationships that impact happiness.
### Customer Churn Prediction in U.S. Banking: 
  Project that aims to predict customer churn in a U.S. bank, determining whether a customer will continue with their account or close it. The dataset comprises information about various U.S. bank customers. The analysis involves comparing the effectiveness of different classification methods, including Logistic Regression, LDA model, QDA model, and KNN model.

### Harnessing Twitter API for AWS S3 Integration
  Gather tweets that mention a specific name, utilizing the robust capabilities of the Twitter API, and analysze the tweets that will then be stored in Amazon Web Services' Simple Storage Service (AWS S3). By integrating these technologies, the project aims to streamline the process of collecting and archiving relevant Twitter mentions, providing a scalable and accessible solution for data storage in the AWS cloud environment.

### Econometrics Exploration of Labor Dynamics
  This econometrics project utilizes the rich dataset from the Current Population Survey (CPS), that offers a wealth of information on crucial aspects of the labor market. The project's objective is to delve into the CPS data to uncover and analyze relationships within labor dynamics. By employing econometric techniques, the study aims to provide insights into the intricate interplay of variables influencing the economic landscape as captured by the comprehensive CPS dataset.

### Amazon's Fulfillment Centers Trip Optimization
  Developed a Python algorithm to address Amazon.com's order fulfillment challenge, which involves minimizing labor costs by reducing the number of cart trips required to fulfill customer orders in manual order fulfillment centers. The algorithm should take into account the volumes of items provided for various scenarios, aiming to optimize the selection of items for each cart trip. The goal is to design a solution that explicitly specifies the items included in each cart trip, implicitly determining the minimum number of cart trips needed to fulfill orders efficiently. 

### Cell Tower Network Optimization
  Verizon continuously evaluates the strategic expansion of their cell tower infrastructure to enhance service for existing customers (minimizing dropped calls) and to attract new customers for revenue growth. The algorithm identifies optimal locations for constructing new cell towers, considering factors such as population growth in specific regions, changes in competitors' tower assets, and adherence to an annual budget constraint. The goal is to maximize the capacity for handling new calls while staying within the allocated budget.
