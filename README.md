# Data Analytics Portfolio 
Repository containing some projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

### NASDAQ stock portfolio 
  Developed a Python program utilizing R, MySQL, Gurobi, Excel and Solver to assist users in selecting  NASDAQ stocks portfolio, by computing efficient frontier.  The project uses data that consists of average monthly returns for many different NASDAQ stock over several year, and generates a graph illustrating maximized returns at various risk levels with R markdown. It also includes using R to populate the covariance matrix, Python to create the Gurobi model, and SQL to create the database dump that supports R and Python. 

### Targeted Marketing for Grocery Store
  The project involves creating a segmentation model based on customer behavior and purchase patterns. The goal is to identify opportunities for higher campaign profits through targeted marketing efforts. By addressing specific customer needs, the project aims to boost satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of the company's marketing strategy.

 ### Happiness Report Exploratory Analysis: 
  This project delves into the World Happiness Report, a comprehensive survey ranking 155 countries by their happiness levels. The project's primary objective is to conduct an exploratory analysis, leveraging machine learning techniques to unveil relationships that impact happiness.
  
### Customer Churn Prediction in U.S. Banking: 
  Project that aims to predict customer churn in a U.S. bank, determining whether a customer will continue with their account or close it. The dataset comprises information about various U.S. bank customers. The analysis involves comparing the effectiveness of different classification methods, including Logistic Regression, LDA model, QDA model, and KNN model.

### Harnessing Twitter API for AWS S3 Integration
  Gather tweets that mention a specific name, utilizing the robust capabilities of the Twitter API, and analysze the tweets that will then be stored in Amazon Web Services' Simple Storage Service (AWS S3). By integrating these technologies, the project aims to streamline the process of collecting and archiving relevant Twitter mentions, providing a scalable and accessible solution for data storage in the AWS cloud environment.

### Amazon's Fulfillment Centers Trip Analysis 
  Developed a Python algorithm to address Amazon.com's order fulfillment challenge, which involves minimizing labor costs by reducing the number of cart trips required to fulfill customer orders in fulfillment centers. The algorithm should take into account the volumes of items provided for various scenarios, aiming to optimize the selection of items for each cart trip. 

### Cell Tower Network Algorithm
  Verizon evaluates the strategic expansion of their cell tower infrastructure to enhance service. The algorithm identifies optimal locations for constructing new cell towers, considering factors such as population growth in specific regions, changes in competitors' tower assets, and adherence to an annual budget constraint. 

### Optimal Carrier Assignment for Westvaco's Distribution Challenge

Westvaco Company, a manufacturer is currently tackling a distribution challenge. The project focused on efficiently assigning carriers to planned loads, each designated for diverse locations with distinct rates. The project determined the most cost-effective assignment of truckloads to carriers, ensuring all necessary requirements are met, and calculating the associated costs of this optimized distributionÂ plan.

### Econometrics Exploration of Labor Dynamics
  This econometrics project utilizes the rich dataset from the Current Population Survey (CPS), that offers a wealth of information on crucial aspects of the labor market. The project delved into the CPS data to uncover and analyze relationships within labor dynamics. By employing econometric techniques, the study aims to provide insights into the intricate interplay of variables influencing the economic landscape.
